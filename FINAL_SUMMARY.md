A: 100% local storage. Perfect for HIPAA, GDPR. Data never leaves your server.

**Q: Can it scale?**
A: Yes! 100+ users locally. Easy migration to cloud vector DBs (Qdrant, Weaviate) for unlimited scale.

**Q: What's the tech stack?**
A: TypeScript, LangChain, Qwen 2.5 72B, Vector embeddings, Semantic search.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**
A: Self-hosted: ~$0.01 per 1000 queries. Cloud: ~$0.05 per 1000 queries.

**Q: Who are your competitors?**
A: Pinecone ($70/month), ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), LangChain Memory (expensive).

**Q: What's your moat?**
A: AI-based filtering (unique), perfect recall, privacy-first, fully customizable.

**Q: What's the market size?**
A: $50B+ AI market. Every company needs AI with memory.
