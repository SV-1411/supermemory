## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Before Demo!)

### Test Everything:
```bash
# 1. Test chat
npm run chat

# 2. Test memory storage
You: My name is Test User
You: /stats  # Should show 1+ memories

# 3. Test memory recall
You: What's my name?  # Should recall "Test User"

# 4. Exit and restart
You: /exit
npm run chat

# 5. Test persistence
You: What's my name?  # Should still remember!
```

### If Something Breaks:
1. Check API key is set
