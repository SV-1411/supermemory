You: Hi, my name is Shivansh and I'm building Gigzs

🤖 AI: Nice to meet you, Shivansh! Gigzs sounds interesting. 
       What kind of platform is it? I'd love to hear more about it!

       on any specific type of gigs or industries?

You: What's my name?

## 🎯 What Makes This Different from ChatGPT?

| **Memory** | Summaries only | EVERYTHING stored as vectors |
| **Recall** | Selective | Semantic search (finds by meaning) |
| **Context** | Limited | Unlimited (all past conversations) |
| **Privacy** | Cloud (OpenAI) | Local storage (your machine) |
| **Cost** | $20/month | FREE with OpenRouter |
| **Customization** | None | Full control |

## 💡 How It Works Now

```
You: "What projects am I working on?"
    ↓
1. Converts query to vector
    ↓
2. Searches ALL past conversations (vector similarity)
    ↓
3. Finds: "I'm building Gigzs" (95% match)
    ↓
4. Sends to AI with context:
   "RELEVANT MEMORIES: User is building Gigzs..."
    ↓
5. AI responds intelligently:
   "You're working on Gigzs, a freelance marketplace!"
```

**The AI actually USES the memories to help you!** 🧠

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "OPENROUTER_API_KEY not found"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Set the key in PowerShell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-key-here"

# Then run
npm run chat
```

### Error: "OpenRouter API error"

**Check:**
1. Is your API key correct?
2. Does it start with `sk-or-v1-`?
3. Did you copy it completely?

**Test your key:**
```powershell
echo $env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

### AI responses are slow
